      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/IMG_2164.jpg">
      <p>I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science
      in Chemistry/Elements of Computing Certificate. I am currently working as an
      Applications Developer at Reynolds&amp;Reynolds as part of the Service
      Application developer team. On my free time, I have been learning to become a
      web developer with focus on Javascript, jQuery, and React.</p>

      <p>Since college, I have been back to Taiwan twice due to the fact that I always
      accidently promise my friends that I will take them there. When I finally learn
      not to do that, I would love to travel to Europe or somewhere that I haven't
      been before. </p>
